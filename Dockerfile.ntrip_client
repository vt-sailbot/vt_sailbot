# This is the general dockerfile that can create an image from any ros package in this directory except (for now) uros 
# which has its own, separate dockerfile to run
# To run this dockerfile and create the image, all you need to do is use the following command: 
# docker build -t [name of the image you would like to create] --build-arg NODE_NAME=[name of the folder that the ros package is in] .

# The name of the image is arbitrary but the convention currently is to use the name: sailbot_[name of the folder that the ros package is in]
# so for example if I am building the rc node, I would do: docker build -t sailbot_rc --build-arg NODE_NAME=rc .
