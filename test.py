*** FOR ILLUSTRATION ONLY - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE ***
PLEASE RESPECT THE TERMS OF USE OF ANY NTRIP CASTER YOU
USE WITH THIS EXAMPLE - INAPPROPRIATE USE CAN RESULT IN
YOUR NTRIP USER ACCOUNT OR IP BEING TEMPORARILY BLOCKED.
This example illustrates how to use the UBXReader and
GNSSNTRIPClient classes to get RTCM3 RTK data from a
designated NTRIP caster/mountpoint and apply it to an
RTK-compatible GNSS receiver (e.g. ZED-F9P) connected to
a local serial port.
GNSSNTRIPClient receives RTK data from the NTRIP caster
and outputs it to a message queue. A send thread reads data
from this queue and sends it to the receiver. A read thread
reads and parses data from the receiver and prints it to the
terminal.
The example also optionally sends NMEA GGA position sentences
to the caster at a prescribed interval, using either fixed
reference coordinates or live coordinates from the receiver.
For brevity, the example will print out just the identities of
all incoming GNSS and NTRIP messages, but the full message can
be printed by setting the global PRINT_FULL variable to True.
The example also includes a simple illustration of horizontal
accuracy. Set the global SHOW_ACCURACY variable to True.
If the receiver is a u-blox UBX receiver, it can be configured
to output UBX RXM-RTCM messages which acknowledge receipt of
incoming RTK data and confirm whether or not it was used (i.e.
RTK correction applied).
NB: Some NTRIP casters may stop sending RTK data after a while
if they're not receiving legitimate NMEA GGA position updates
from the client.
