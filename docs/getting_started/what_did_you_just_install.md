## What is a Development Container and Why are We Using One?

A development container is a virtualized environment where you can skip setup and not worry about operating system specific software. Some of the software that we use only works on certain versions on Ubuntu and is really hard to get your hands on with other operating systems. There are also a lot of packages that this project relies on, which can be a pain to manually install, so docker development containers automate that process and allow you to start developing instantely. Additionally this helps automate and streamline deployment on the Nvidia Jetson microprocessor.
